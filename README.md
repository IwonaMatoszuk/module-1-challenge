# Module 1 Challenge

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Description

This challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which requires me to refactor starter code to make it more accessible. Refactoring means, modifying without changing what the code actually does. 

The changes I have made:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
